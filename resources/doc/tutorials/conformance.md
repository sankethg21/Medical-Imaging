This page details which parts of DICOM the DWV supports and also plans to support... This is mainly guided by the demo data that I have, so if you have data that is not supported, please provide me some and I'll try to integrate it.

Main reference: [DICOM/2013](http://dicom.nema.org/dicom/2013/output/chtml/part01/PS3.1.html). The dictionary was generated using [part06/chapter_6](http://dicom.nema.org/dicom/2013/output/chtml/part06/chapter_6.html).

## Validity

All DICOM files should start with the DICOM prefix `DICM` (see [DICOM File Meta Information](http://dicom.nema.org/dicom/2013/output/chtml/part10/chapter_7.html#sect_7.1)). If not, it is not a valid DICOM. Since v0.26 ([#188](https://github.com/ivmartel/dwv/issues/188)), the parser will attempt to parse data without the prefix but there are no guaranty of results!

## Transfer syntax

See the [definition](http://dicom.nema.org/dicom/2013/output/chtml/part05/chapter_10.html) and the UID [list](http://dicom.nema.org/dicom/2013/output/chtml/part06/chapter_A.html#table_A-1).

## Photometric Interpretation

See the [definition](http://dicom.nema.org/dicom/2013/output/chtml/part03/sect_C.7.html#sect_C.7.6.3.1.2). The planar configuration ([definition](http://dicom.nema.org/dicom/2013/output/chtml/part03/sect_C.7.html#sect_C.7.6.3.1.3)) is used to define the memory layout of colour images.

- `MONOCHROME1` -> &#x2705; _(since v0.2)_
- `MONOCHROME2` -> &#x2705; _(since v0.3)_
- `PALETTE COLOUR` -> &#x2705; _(since v0.27, see [#664](https://github.com/ivmartel/dwv/issues/664))_
- `RGB` -> &#x2705; _(since v0.3, both planar configuration)_
- `YBR_FULL` -> &#x274C;
- `YBR_FULL_422` -> &#x2705; _(since v0.15)_
- `YBR_PARTIAL_422` -> &#x274C;
- `YBR_PARTIAL_420` -> &#x274C;
- `YBR_ICT` -> &#x274C;
- `YBR_RCT` -> &#x274C;

## Data elements

All Value Representations (VR) should be supported. See the official [list](http://dicom.nema.org/dicom/2013/output/chtml/part05/sect_6.2.html#table_6.2-1).

## Dicom web

Web Access to Dicom persistent Objects (see [DICOMweb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICOMweb))

### WADO-RS

-> RESTful Services (RS) (see [Part 3.18 sect 6.5](https://dicom.nema.org/dicom/2013/output/chtml/part18/sect_6.5.html))

WADO-RS is supported via the `MultipartLoader` since <font color="green">v0.31</font>.

The default `Accept` header should be something like: `multipart/related; type="application/dicom"; transfer-syntax=*'`.

The `tests/pacs/dcmweb.html` test page allows to connect to an Orthanc instance and retrieve data from it.

### WADO-URI

-> URI based (see [Part 3.18 sect 6.2](https://dicom.nema.org/dicom/2013/output/chtml/part18/sect_6.2.html))

WADO-URI can be provided in the DWV URL using `?input=` since <font color="green">v0.3</font>.

Arguments follow regular URI standard.

- `requestType`: WADO. **Required**
- `contentType`: **Required**
  - application/dicom (see transfer syntax above for support)
  - image/jpeg &#x2705; _(since v0.3)_
  - image/gif &#x2705; _(since v0.3)_
  - image/png &#x2705; _(since v0.3)_
  - image/jp2 &#x274C;
- `studyUID`, `seriesUID`, `objectUID`. **Required**
- `anonymise`: true or false.
- If the type is image, then `rows`, `columns`, `windowWidth`, `windowCenter` and more can be specified.

Example url:

```
http://dicom.vital-it.ch:8089/wado?
   requestType=WADO&
   contentType=application/dicom&
   studyUID=2.16.840.1.113669.632.20.1211.10000744858&
   seriesUID=1.3.6.1.4.1.19291.2.1.2.2413568109772100001&
   objectUID=1.3.6.1.4.1.19291.2.1.3.2413568110716100007
```

Example server: [dicomserver.co.uk](http://www.dicomserver.co.uk), [search](http://www.dicomserver.co.uk/wado/).

## Pixel data

File data storage, either one frame per file or multiple:

- `Single-frame data`: &#x2705; _(from start!)_
- `Multi-frame data`: &#x2705; _(since v0.15.0, see [#132](https://github.com/ivmartel/dwv/issues/132))_

## Character sets

- without code extensions: &#x2705; _(since v0.15.0, see [#248](https://github.com/ivmartel/dwv/issues/248))_
- with code extensions: &#x274C;

## IOD and Modules

The Part PS 3.3 of the DICOM Standard specifies the set of Information Object Definitions (IODs) which provide an abstract definition of real-world objects applicable to communication of digital medical information. The Attributes of an IOD describe the properties of a Real-World Object Instance. Related Attributes are grouped into [Modules](http://dicom.nema.org/dicom/2013/output/chtml/part03/chapter_C.html) which represent a higher level of semantics documented in the Module Specifications found in Annex C of the DICOM Standard.

An overview of modules for each IOD is defined in [sect_A.1.4](https://dicom.nema.org/dicom/2013/output/chtml/part03/chapter_A.html#sect_A.1.4) (legend: [sect_A.1.3](https://dicom.nema.org/dicom/2013/output/chtml/part03/chapter_A.html#sect_A.1.3)).

Some IODs:

- [CT](https://dicom.nema.org/dicom/2013/output/chtml/part03/sect_A.3.html)
- [MR](https://dicom.nema.org/dicom/2013/output/chtml/part03/sect_A.4.html)
- [RT Image](https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part03/sect_A.17.3.html)
- [PET](https://dicom.nema.org/dicom/2013/output/chtml/part03/sect_A.21.html)
- [Segmentation](https://dicom.nema.org/dicom/2013/output/chtml/part03/sect_A.51.html)
